# CITS4401 - Badminton-Automated-Game-Scheduling-System 
Django/Python Limited Functionality Prototype

## Basic description
During Semester 1 of 2018 we were required to complete a Requirement Analysis Document followed by a System Design Document based upon some initial information we were provide in regards to Badminton Automated Game Scheduling System. We were also required to submit a rough prototype using any programming language we wanted too. 
Given my recent interest in web development aspects, I chose Django/python as this could be be there perfect opportunity to familiarise myself with these frameworks. 
I plan on extending the functionality of the prototype after my exams have been complete to progress further with my understanding of Django framework.
